# So You've Retired

<span style="color:#00ccff;">**So You've Retired - A Practical Guide For Your Happy Retirement**</span>

As a thank you for reading my book I have created a **Retirement Action Plan**, which can be used to assist with savings calculations, while putting together a plan for when you can retire. This is referenced in my other book, "How To Retire".

**[Retirement Action Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A0_02AaFvuEWktk-yS2biNi_lTg2il43i6xLN7qiCJ4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" style="color:#00ccff;"}**

*The plan listed on this page is intended to offer assistance for thinking about your retirement plans, however it is in no way intended as financial advice. You should always* ***do your own research*** *and seek advice from a registered financial professional. You agree that by clicking any links on this site and using the content therein, that you do so at your own risk, and acknowledge that you have not received financial advice from this site.*
