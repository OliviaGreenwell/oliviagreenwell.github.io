# So You've Retired

As a thank you for reading my book and joining my mailing list, I have created a special resource area.

Here you will find a **Retirement Action Plan**, which can be used to assist with savings calculations, while putting together a plan for when you can retire. This is referenced in my other book, "How To Retire".
