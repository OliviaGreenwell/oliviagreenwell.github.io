<span style="color:#00ccff;">**How To Retire - A Practical Guide As You Countdown To Retirement**</span>

As a thank you for reading my book I have created a **Retirement Action Plan**, which you can use to assist with your savings calculations, as you put together your Retirement Master Plan.

**[Retirement Action Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A0_02AaFvuEWktk-yS2biNi_lTg2il43i6xLN7qiCJ4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" style="color:#00ccff;"}**

*The plan listed on this page is intended to offer assistance for thinking about your retirement plans, however it is in no way intended as financial advice. You should always* ***do your own research*** *and seek advice from a registered financial professional. You agree that by clicking any links on this site and using the content therein, that you do so at your own risk, and acknowledge that you have not received financial advice from this site.*
