# About Olivia

A recently retired hotel front desk manager, Olivia Greenwell is now pursuing her long-term personal goal of being a published author. Residing in Tampa, Florida she enjoys spending her days going for long walks with her little dog Sammy, discovering a new love for baking, working on her writing projects and spending time with her two grand children.

Olivia’s favorite thing to do is watch the sunset from the beach while reflecting on the day just spent and making plans for the next day.

Having published her first book **[So You've Retired? A Practical Guide For Your Happy Retirement](https://www.amazon.com/So-Youve-Retired-Practical-Retirement/dp/153540809X){:target="_blank" style="color:#00ccff;"}** in 2016, she is now hard at work on her next book about how to plan for a happy and wealthy retirement, due to be published early 2017.
