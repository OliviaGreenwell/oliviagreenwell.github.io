# About Olivia

<span style="font-weight:400;">A recently retired hotel front desk manager, Olivia Greenwell is now pursuing her long-term personal goal of being a published author. Residing in Tampa, Florida she enjoys spending her days going for long walks with her little dog Sammy, discovering a new love for baking, working on her writing projects and spending time with her two grand children.</span>
